Get Higher Fitness Web Design Performance: Showcase fitness & wellness testimonials, reviews, and case studies better and easier.

== Description ==

Testimonials are often crucial part of a company website but fitness and wellness professionals know they are particularly important in conveying the value of their service. The problem is, it takes so much time and effort to organize all of the information and publish on websites in a consistent and professional way when you have dozens or even hundreds of them. Shingo Suzumura and his [fitness web design](http://fitnesswebsiteformula.com/ "fitness web design") team at Fitness Website Formula developed this plugin from the ground up to help fitness professionals showcase their work better as a strong form of [social proof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof "Social Proof is a marketing term").

With this [Fitness Testimonials plugin](http://fitnesswebsiteformula.com/wordpress-fitness-testimonials/), you can quickly create wellness and fitness driven websites that directly convey the value of your service without any web design skills like coding and photoshop.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

[Usage Examples and Documentation](http://fitnesswebsiteformula.com/wordpress-fitness-testimonials/docs/ "Documentation")

**How do I add testimonials?**

To insert testimonial(s) within another content (i.e. pages), look for a blue toolbar icon when you are in the "Visual" editor mode. If you use visual composer plugin, you will need to switch back to the WordPress editing mode first. 

Your shortcode will look similar to:

[fitness-testimonials id="1" limit="10" excerpt="true" javascript="true" random="true" like_button="top" ]

* `id` is your testimonial group ID number (Required)
* `limit` sets a maximum number of testimonials to display (Optional)
* `excerpt` plugin uses a short testimonial instead of the full version if found (Optional)
* `javascript` testimonials will be generated by Javascript, which prevents search engines from caching your content if you need to use for SEO (Optional)
* `random` testimonials will be displayed in an random order (Optional)
* `like_button` adds (Optional)

You can also embed it manually in your PHP file:

`<?php do_shortcode(' [fitness-testimonials id="xx"] '); ?>`

**Where do I add the video?**

You can simply add/insert it into the WordPress text editor box.

**How do I change the template design?**

You have simple options under the "Style" tab as well as “Advanced” tab for more advanced users.

**How do I use the shortcode outside the post editor, such as in theme or template files, or in widgets?**

`<?php do_shortcode(' [fitness-testimonials id="xx"] '); ?>`

**Can I upload multiple images? More than two?**

Currently you can only add up to 2 images.

**How do I customize the look of a single testimonial page?**

You can copy `single-testimonial.php` from the fitness-testimonials/includes/ folder to your own theme folder and make any edits there. The plugin looks for it in your theme folder first and then the plugin folder.
